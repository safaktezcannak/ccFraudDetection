Credit Card Fraud Dedection with Data Mining Techniques

# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project aims to develop machine learning models to detect credit card fraud using various algorithms. The project includes implementations of different machine learning models and uses two primary datasets for training and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `mlp1.py`: Implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model.
- `mlp2.py`: Additional implementation details or enhancements for the MLP model.
- `rf1.py`: Implementation of a Random Forest (RF) model.
- `rf2.py`: Additional implementation details or enhancements for the RF model.
- `xgb1.py`: Implementation of an XGBoost (XGB) model.
- `xgb2.py`: Additional implementation details or enhancements for the XGB model.
- `xgb3.py`: Further implementation details or enhancements for the XGB model.
- `datasets.txt`: Contains links to the datasets used in this project.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this project are large, so they are not included directly in this repository. You can download the datasets from the following links:

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Project Details
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
The MLP model is implemented in mlp1.py and mlp2.py. This model uses a neural network approach to detect fraudulent transactions.

Random Forest (RF)
The RF model is implemented in rf1.py and rf2.py. This model uses an ensemble of decision trees to improve the accuracy of fraud detection.

XGBoost (XGB)
The XGB model is implemented in xgb1.py, xgb2.py, and xgb3.py. This model utilizes gradient boosting techniques to enhance the prediction performance.
